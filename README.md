#### My name is Kaustubh Funde and I am a MERN stack developer with working knowledge of MySQL and PostgreSQL as well. I enjoy working on backend as a whole and creating full stack applications from scratch, seometimes with a bit of Machine Learning sprinkled in.
#### I am going to start my transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 soon, mainly because cryptography itself is very stimulating for me and I hope to grow as a developer in this journey.
