## My name is Kaustubh Funde (he / him) and I am a MERN stack developer with working knowledge of MySQL and PostgreSQL as well. I enjoy working on backend as a whole.
## I am going to start my transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 soon, mainly because cryptography itself is very stimulating for me and I hope to grow as a developer in this journey.
